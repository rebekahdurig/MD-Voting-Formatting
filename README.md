# MD-Voting-Formatting

These functions are used to read common formats of voting data in Maryland, as a project for a non-partisian non-profit organization. While these functions are definitely non-exhaustive in being able to read all voting data, they are able to be quite flexible for HTML or PDF functions and extract data much faster than manually copying it (and generally are more accurate, except in the case where images are stored as PDFs).
