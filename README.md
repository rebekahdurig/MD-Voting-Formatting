# MD-Voting-Formatting

This is an example of text extraction in R. Project is still in process, as I'm using these functions to get data in a few cities for the elections going back to 2014. These functions are flexible enough to handle many standard text PDFs with voting information, but the image processing here is not good yet, but maybe better than nothing?

These functions are used to read common formats of voting data in Maryland, as a project for a non-partisian non-profit organization. While these functions are definitely non-exhaustive in being able to read all voting data, they are able to be quite flexible for HTML or PDF functions and extract data much faster than manually copying it (and generally are more accurate, except in the case where images are stored as PDFs).

If you find this, hope it's helpful.
